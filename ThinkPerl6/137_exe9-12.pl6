# Exercise 9-12.
# Two words “interlock” if taking alternating letters from each forms a new word. For
# example, “shoe” and “cold” interlock to form “schooled.”
# Write a program that finds in words.txt all pairs of words that interlock. Hint: don’t
# enumerate all pairs, there are many of them!
# Solution: “Exercise 9-12: Interlocking Words” on page 399.
