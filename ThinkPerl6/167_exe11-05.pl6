# Exercise 11-5.
# Write a function named choose_from_hist that takes a histogram as defined in
# “Hash as a Collection of Counters” on page 187 and returns a random value from the
# histogram, chosen with probability in proportion to frequency. For example, for the
# three items ('a', 'a', 'b') , your function should return 'a' with probability 2/3
# and 'b' with probability 1/3.
