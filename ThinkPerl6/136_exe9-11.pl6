# Exercise 9-11.
# Two words are a “reverse pair” if each is the reverse of the other. For example, “depot”
# and “toped” form a reverse pair; other examples include “reward” and “drawer,” or
# “desserts” and “stressed.” Write a program that finds all the reverse pairs in the
# words.txt file.
# Solution: “Exercise 9-11: Reverse Pairs” on page 396.
