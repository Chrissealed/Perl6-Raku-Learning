# Exercise 9-2.
# Write a subroutine called cumul-sum that takes a list of numbers and returns the
# cumulative sum; that is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the first i + 1
# elements from the original list. For example:
# my @nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
# say cumul-sum(@nums);
# # -> [1, 3, 6, 10]
# Solution: “Exercise 9-2: Cumulative Sum” on page 387.
