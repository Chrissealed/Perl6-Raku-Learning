CHAPTER 8

Case Study: Word Play

This chapter is intended to let you practice and consolidate the knowledge you have
acquired so far, rather than introducing new concepts. To help you gain experience
with programming, we will cover a case study that involves solving word puzzles by
searching for words that have certain properties. For example, we’ll find the longest
palindromes in English and search for words whose letters appear in alphabetical
order. And I will present another program development plan: reduction to a previ‐
ously solved problem.
