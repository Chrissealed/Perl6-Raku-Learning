# Exercise 10-1.
# Write a subroutine that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a
# hash. (It doesn’t matter what the values are.) Then you can use the exists adverb as a
# fast way to check whether a string is in the hash.
# If you did Exercise 9-10, you can compare the speed of this implementation with a
# hash and the bisection search.
# Solution: “Exercise 10-1: Storing the Word List into a Hash” on page 401.
