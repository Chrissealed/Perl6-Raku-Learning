Inheritance

Inheritance is probably the most emblematic feature of object-oriented program‚Äê
ming. It is a mechanism through which it is possible to derive a class from another
class. Inheritance is one of the standard ways to implement code reuse in object-
oriented programming. It is also another useful way of defining successive layers of
abstraction and a hierarchy of types.
