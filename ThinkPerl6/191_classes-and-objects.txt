CHAPTER 12

Classes and Objects

At this point you know how to use functions to organize code and built-in types to
organize data. The next step is to learn “object-oriented programming,” which uses
programmer-defined types to organize both code and data.

When software applications start to grow large, the number of details to be handled
becomes overwhelming. The only way to manage this complexity is to use abstraction
and encapsulation. Object orientation is a very popular and efficient way to imple‐
ment abstraction and encapsulation.

Perl 6 is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it provides fea‐
tures that support object-oriented programming, which has these defining character‐
istics:

• Programs include class and method definitions.

• Most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.

• Objects often represent things in the real world, and methods often correspond
to the ways things in the real world interact.

Object-oriented programming in Perl 6 is a big topic that may be worth a book by
itself (and there will probably be a book or two on the subject at some point). This
chapter will hopefully do more than just skim the surface and enable you to create
and use objects, but will not cover some of the details and more advanced features.
