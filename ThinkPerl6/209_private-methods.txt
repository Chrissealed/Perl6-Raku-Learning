Private Methods

Methods are the normal way to use objects, whether with read-only or read and write
access. They usually form the interface of a class, that is the part of the class that is
made public and available to programmers wishing to use them. It is thus natural and
legitimate for methods to be public, i.e., accessible from outside the class.

But a class may also contain numerous methods that are part of the internal cooking
recipes of the class, i.e., the way it does things internally, and that are not meant to be
used from outside the class. It is possible to prevent their use from outside the class
by making these methods private. A Perl 6 private method is prefixed with an excla‐
mation mark:

method !private-behavior($x, $y) {
...
}

You will also need to use an exclamation mark to call them:

$my-object!private-behavior($val1, $val2)

Private methods are really internal to a given class. In particular, they are not inher‐
ited by child classes.
