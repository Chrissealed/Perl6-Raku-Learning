# Exercise 8-3.
# Write a subroutine named avoids that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters,
# and that returns True if the word doesn’t use any of the forbidden letters.
# Next, modify your program to prompt the user to enter a string of forbidden letters
# and then print the number of words that don’t contain any of them. Can you find a
# combination of five forbidden letters that excludes the smallest number of words?
