Building Your Own Data Structures

Perl has a number of compound types such as arrays and hashes that you can com‐
bine to construct arrays of arrays, arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, hashes of hashes,
arrays of arrays of arrays or hashes, and so on, and this is usually sufficient for most
needs. Sometimes, however, you need something very specific that is not built in.
Over the years, computer science has studied and used scores of specific data struc‐
tures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, circular lists, trees of numerous kinds, etc.
We will briefly study a couple of them.
