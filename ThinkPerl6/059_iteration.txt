CHAPTER 6

Iteration

This chapter is about iteration, which is the ability to run a block of statements
repeatedly. We saw a kind of iteration, using recursion, in “Recursion” on page 66. We
saw another kind, using a for loop, in “for Loops” on page 64. In this chapter we’ll see
yet another kind, using a while statement. But first I want to say a little more about
variable assignment.
