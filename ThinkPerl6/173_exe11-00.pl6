# As an exercise, write a multi subroutine that creates the new postfix “!” operator for
# computing the factorial of an integer:
# say 5!;
# # -> 120
# Also try to think about how you would test this new “!” operator against various
# input values. Solution: “Exercise: Constructing New Operators” on page 407.
