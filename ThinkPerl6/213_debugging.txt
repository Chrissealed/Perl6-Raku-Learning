Debugging

This section is about using a debugger, a program that is designed to help you to
debug your programs. “What? There is a tool to debug my programs, and you’re tell‐
ing me only now?” you might complain. Well, it’s not quite that. A debugger is not
going to do the debugging for you; you’ll still have to do the hard investigation work,
but a debugger can help you a lot in figuring out why your program isn’t doing what
you think it should be doing. Or, rather, why what your program is doing isn’t quite
what you want it to do.

Debuggers are a bit like people with a strong personality: some people love them and
others hate them. Often, people who don’t like debuggers simply never took the time
to learn how to use them, but there are also many expert programmers who don’t like
them and whom we can’t suspect of not having seriously tried. Whether you like
debuggers or not is probably a matter of personal taste, but they can provide invalua‐
ble help, if you know how to use them.
