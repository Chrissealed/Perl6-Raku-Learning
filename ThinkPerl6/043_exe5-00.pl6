# As an exercise, use incremental development to write a function called hypotenuse that
# returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two
# legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go. Solution:
# “Exercise: Hypotenuse” on page 356.
