CHAPTER 11

Case Study: Data Structure Selection

At this point you have learned about Perlâ€™s core data structures, and you have seen
some of the algorithms that use them.
This chapter presents a case study with exercises that let you think about choosing
data structures and practice using them.
But first, I would like to briefly introduce two conditional structures that have been
left aside so far and provide a couple of new possibilities about subroutine signatures.
