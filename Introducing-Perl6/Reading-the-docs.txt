  <#___top>INTRODUCTION§ <#INTRODUCTION>

Program |p6doc| is a command-line-interface (CLI) program that reads
Perl 6 pod from *installed* modules' source code, in contrast to running
|perl6 --doc=MODULE programfile| which reads Perl 6 pod from the named
source file.

Note that |p6doc| may not be installed automatically depending upon how
you installed Rakudo Perl 6. To install it use |zef|:

zef install p6doc


  SYNOPSIS <#___top>§ <#SYNOPSIS>

p6doc [switches] [arguments]


  DESCRIPTION <#___top>§ <#DESCRIPTION>

With no switches or arguments, |p6doc| lists its help to |$*OUT| (|stdout|):

You want to maintain the index?
To build an index for 'p6doc -f'
          p6doc build
 
To list the index keys
          p6doc list
 
To display module name(s) containing key
          p6doc lookup
 
To show where the index file lives
          p6doc path-to-index
 
What documentation do you want to read?
Examples: p6doc Str
          p6doc Str.split
          p6doc faq
          p6doc path/to/file
 
You can list some top level documents:
          p6doc -l
 
You can also look up specific method/routine/sub definitions:
          p6doc -f hyper
          p6doc -f Array.push
 
You can bypass the pager and print straight to stdout:
          p6doc -n Str

The text output can be captured and converted to other forms if desired.

If you want to use ANSI escape sequences, which will apply boldface and
other enhancements to the output, you will have to set POD_TO_TEXT_ANSI,
which is unset by default

export POD_TO_TEXT_ANSI=1


  LIMITATIONS <#___top>§ <#LIMITATIONS>

Currently |p6doc| can only extract embedded Perl 6 pod from installed
module source files (as listed in a distribution's |META6.json| file).
It is planned to add a feature for |p6doc| (in conjunction with
|META6.json| changes) to extract *all* Perl 6 pod in files included with
the installed distribution.
